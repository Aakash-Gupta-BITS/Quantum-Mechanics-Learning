# Postulates of Quantum Mechanics
## Introduction
I did the revision of discrete cases of quantum mechanics that was covered in QiC course because I am comfortable with that notation and think it will be a good starting point to get into continuous case of quantum mechanics, using the same notation.

## Video Lectures
The YouTube playlist [Professor M does Science - The Postulates of Quantum Mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8W2boV7eVfmMcKF-ljTvAJQ2z-vILSxb) covers the postulates of quantum mechanics in braket notation with easy to understand material.
It covers continuous case too and covers the concepts without going into exact numerical calculations. It also derives and proves the properties of various objects that are associated with quantum mechanics.

      - Function of Hermitian operator with complex coefficients is not Hermititan!!
      - Eigenvalues of function of an operator are function of Eigenvalues of that operator.
      - $[A,F(B)]=0$ where $A$ and $B$ commute.
      - Special case that is valid for position and momentum operators: if $[A,[A,B]]=0$ and $[B,[A,B]]=0$, then $[A,B^n]=n[A,B]B^{n-1}$ and in general, $[A,F(B)]=[A,B]F'(B)$.

## Notes
1. Videos are not substitute of book. Always prefer book than videos, as videos are there to help us understand things but absolute understanding comes from reading the book. Book covers everything, while video only selected portions.
