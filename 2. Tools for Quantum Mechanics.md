# Tools for Quantum Mechanics
Here, I learned about various important results related to quantum mechanics that are not tied to any specific problem in hand, but rather are applicable to the whole theory in general.

## Video Lectures
The video lectures and corresponding reference to topic in the book is provided.

### Wave Mechanics [[Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8W2boV7eVfnHHCwSB7Y0jtvyWkN49UaZ)]
This covers the oprators with which we will work: translation, position and momentum. This also covers the representation of momentum operator in position space.
1. [The translation operator in quantum mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=978mMgGYs1M)
   - Definition.
   - Non Hamiltonian, Unitary.
   - Commutator of this operator with position operator and proof that action of this operator on state in position basis is a translation in position - proof that this definiton of operator gives us an translation in position basis.
   - Adjoint and Taylor Expansion.
2. [Wave functions in quantum mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lr3aA4vaBs)
   - Definitons in terms of bras and kets.
   - Scalar Product and Normalisation constant.
   - Finding scalar product of position and momentum operator.
   - Conversion between momentum and position representation.
   - Generalisation to 3D.
3. [Position and momentum operators acting on wave functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw2YrTLSq5U)
   - Revision.
   - Derivation of action of momentum representation in position basis and vice versa.
   - Generalisation to 3D.


### Time evolution in quantum mechanics [[Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8W2boV7eVflUqUY3dLhQdYuZjlbXi0mU)]
This portion is covered on page 145 of the book, I guess. The **Ehrenfest theorem** is covered in chapter 6 of the book.

   - Equation for multiple consecutive time evolutions.
   - Inverse of time evolution.
   - Infinitesimal time evolution operator and $\hat{U}(t,t')$ is unitary.
   - Time evolution for conservative system.
   - Equation for time evolution is not like solution of linear differential equation in time-dependent hamiltonian!
3. [The Ehrenfest Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55RQCCtdlko) - Classical Limit.
   - Time dependent expectation value.
   - Derivative of expectation value of a time dependent operator.
   - Result for position and momentum operators and thus similarity with Newton's second law of motion.
   - Trying to make a connection from quantum to classical world about the center of mass of wave packet.
   - Free Particle, uniform force field and harmonic oscillators - wave packet behave like classical one!
   - Quassi-classical regime.
4. [Constants of motion in quantum mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r38VW3JwBAk) - Conservative Quantities.
   - Definition.
   - Time independent expectation value.
   - Common set of eigenstates with Hamiltonian: good quantum numbers.
   - Probability of measurement outcome is time independent.
5. [The time-energy uncertainity principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auLZ2WOKiqE)
   - Revision of Basics.
   - **LEFT WATCHING THE VIDEO. WAS GOING ABOVE THE HEAD. WILL CONTINUE LATER**.
   
### Density Operator in quantum mechanics [[Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8W2boV7eVflL73N8668N0EQUnID1XaEU)]
This portion is covered in the book on page 133.
1. [Pure vs. mixed quantum states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR5kfhrs4Cc).
   - Revision of postulates of quantum mechanics for superposition state.

   - Expectation - $\left\langle \hat{A}\right\rangle =Tr(\hat{\rho}\hat{A})$.
   - Probability of measurement outcome - $Tr(\hat{\rho}\hat{A})$.
   - Time evolution of quantum state:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\hat{\rho}(t)=\frac{1}{\iota\hbar}\left[\hat{H}(t),\hat{\rho}(t)\right].$$
3. [Density operator for mixed quantum states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg0SMY40q8Q).
   - Formula derived such that probability of measurement outcome remains same as pure state.
   - Hermitian.
   - Normalisation - $Tr(\hat{\rho})=1$.
   - Expectation - $\left\langle \hat{A}\right\rangle =Tr(\hat{\rho}\hat{A})$.
   - Time evolution of quantum state:

   - Not idempotent and $Tr(\hat{\rho}^2)<1$.

### Principles of Quantum Mechanics
1. Chapter 6 - The Classical Limit.

## Questions left unanswered
1. Why momentum and position operators are hermitian.
2. Why their commutator is $i\hbar$.
