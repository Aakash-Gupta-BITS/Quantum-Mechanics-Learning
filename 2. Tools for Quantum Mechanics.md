# Tools for Quantum Mechanics
Here, I learned about various important results related to quantum mechanics that are not tied to any specific problem in hand, but rather are applicable to the whole theory in general.

## Video Lectures
The video lectures and corresponding reference to topic in the book is provided.

### Density Operator in quantum mechanics [[Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8W2boV7eVflL73N8668N0EQUnID1XaEU)]
This portion is covered in the book on page 133.
1. [Pure vs. mixed quantum states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR5kfhrs4Cc).
   - Revision of postulates of quantum mechanics for superposition state.
   - Statistical mixture of states vs superposition state.
   - Interference term in superposition state.
   - Pure state and mixed state definition.
2. [Density operator for pure quantum states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQEtg8pWT8E).
   - Formula and matrix entries.
   - Properties - Hermitian, Idempotent, no global phase ambiguity.
   - Normalisation - $Tr(\hat{\rho})=1$.
   - Expectation - $\left\langle \hat{A}\right\rangle =Tr(\hat{\rho}\hat{A})$.
   - Probability of measurement outcome - $Tr(\hat{\rho}\hat{A})$.
   - Time evolution of quantum state:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\hat{\rho}(t)=\frac{1}{\iota\hbar}\left[\hat{H}(t),\hat{\rho}(t)\right].$$
3. [Density operator for mixed quantum states](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg0SMY40q8Q).
   - Formula derived such that probability of measurement outcome remains same as pure state.
   - Hermitian.
   - Normalisation - $Tr(\hat{\rho})=1$.
   - Expectation - $\left\langle \hat{A}\right\rangle =Tr(\hat{\rho}\hat{A})$.
   - Time evolution of quantum state:
$$\frac{d}{dt}\hat{\rho}(t)=\frac{1}{\iota\hbar}\left[\hat{H}(t),\hat{\rho}(t)\right].$$
   - Not idempotent and $Tr(\hat{\rho}^2)<1$.


### Time evolution in quantum mechanics [[Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8W2boV7eVflUqUY3dLhQdYuZjlbXi0mU)]
This portion is covered on page 145 of the book, I guess. The **Ehrenfest theorem** is covered in chapter 6 of the book.
1. The Schrödinger equation -- Already Covered.
2. [The time evolution operator in quantum mechanics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqmU4dW03aM).
   - Meaning of variables in the Schrödinger equation.
   - Time evolution operator $\hat{U}(t,t_0)$.
   - Differential equation for time evolution operator.
   - Integral equation for time evolution operator.
   - Equation for multiple consecutive time evolutions.
   - Inverse of time evolution.
   - Infinitesimal time evolution operator and $\hat{U}(t,t')$ is unitary.
   - Time evolution for conservative system.
   - Equation for time evolution is not like solution of linear differential equation in time-dependent hamiltonian!
3. [The Ehrenfest Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55RQCCtdlko) - Classical Limit.
   - Time dependent expectation value.
   - Derivative of expectation value of a time dependent operator.
   - Result for position and momentum operators and thus similarity with Newton's second law of motion.
   - Trying to make a connection from quantum to classical world about the center of mass of wave packet.
   - Free Particle, uniform force field and harmonic oscillators - wave packet behave like classical one!
   - Quassi-classical regime.

   - Definition.
   - Time independent expectation value.
   - Common set of eigenstates with Hamiltonian: good quantum numbers.
   - Probability of measurement outcome is time independent.
5. [The time-energy uncertainity principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auLZ2WOKiqE)
   - Revision of Basics.
   - **LEFT WATCHING THE VIDEO. WAS GOING ABOVE THE HEAD. WILL CONTINUE LATER**.
