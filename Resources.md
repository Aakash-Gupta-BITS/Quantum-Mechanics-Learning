# Motivation
1. What is the motivation to study quantum mechanics that I tell others even if I don't have anything to do with it in my career?
   - Vellapan and nothing else to do.
2. What is the motivation that I tell myself to study quantum mechanics?
  - I like many fields, including Math, Physics, CS, Finance (new thing for me), Philosophy (?) etc. and I don't know why. In physics, there are two beautiful theories that I know and want to learn: Relativity (Special and General Both) and Quantum mechanics. Why? To explore the secrets of universe and I don't see any reason why not to do that. It gives me a sense of power to predict how things around us work in the universe. Also, I like to play with linear algebra (from 3 Blue 1 Brown, Mathematics 2 and QiC course from college), Fourier Analysis (Competitive Programming, 3 Blue 1 Brown, Infinite Powers book, Waves etc) and I think quantum mechanics is filled with these tools. How nature works at small scale is a wonderful thing as it is very different from day to day experiences.


# Resouces
1. Feynman Lectures Volume 3, online website for the feeling.
2. R. Shankar's book on "Principles of Quantum Mechanics" - I learned braket notation for QiC from this and the very good book which helped me a lot to understand the math.
3. QM2 Course Books.

# Learning
## What I skipped and why?
1. History of why classical mechanics is not good on small scale.
   - I know about this for a very long time from youtube and experiments don't align with classical predictions.
2. Double Slit Experiment.
   - Covered in class XII and taught beautifully by N.V. Sir's video.
