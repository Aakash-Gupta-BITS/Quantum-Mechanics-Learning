# Introductory Examples
## Points to note about the Solution of Schr√∂dinger equation
1. We can's have energy of a particle less than the potential it is in. [Section 3.6 of Quantum Mechanics Second Edition by B.H. Bransden and C.J. Joachain]
2. If our potential is finite everywhere, then $\psi'(x)$ and $\psi(x)$ are continuous.
3. If potential is infinite in some region, then we can only say that $\psi(x)$ is continuous.
4. We will solve time independent equation for $\psi(x)$, and general time dependent solution $\Psi(x,t)$ can be found easily.
5. Bound and Scattering States. [Griffith's Quantum Mechanics, Section 2.5]
6. Even Potential Function means Wave function is either even or odd. [Problem 2.1 of Griffith's book]

## Examples
1. Particle in an infinite well.
2. Delta Potential - infinite wall and well - scattering and bound states.
3. Particle in a well with finite potential walls.
